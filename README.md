# SQL-EDA-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis using Microsfot SQL server, created Database., Joined tables and extracted business insights.

# 📊 SQL Exploratory Data Analysis & Reporting Project
## 📌 Project Overview

### This project focuses on end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL, followed by business-ready reporting.
The objective was to deeply understand the database, extract meaningful insights, and convert them into reusable reports that can be exported and consumed by stakeholders.

### The project concludes with two consolidated reports:
- Customer Report
- Product Report

### Both reports are created as SQL views and exported as CSV files for downstream usage.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### A structured, step-by-step SQL-based exploratory analysis was performed to understand the data before building reports.

### ✔️ Types of Analysis Performed
- Database Exploration
  - Identified tables, relationships, keys, and data availability.
- Dimension Exploration
  - Analyzed categorical fields such as customers, products, categories, regions, and segments.
- Date Range Exploration
  - Checked data coverage, start/end dates, and active periods.
- Measure Exploration
  - Evaluated numerical fields like sales, quantity, cost, and orders.
- Magnitude Analysis
  - Measured totals, averages, and distributions to understand scale and volume.
- Ranking Analysis
  - Ranked customers and products based on sales, orders, and quantity.
- Change Over Time Analysis
  - Analyzed trends over months to identify growth, decline, and seasonality.
- Cumulative Analysis
  - Calculated running totals to understand long-term contribution.
- Performance Analysis
  - Evaluated entity-level performance against overall metrics.
- Data Segmentation
  - Segmented customers and products based on behavior and revenue contribution.
- Part-to-Whole Analysis
  - Analyzed contribution percentages to total sales and orders.

### Outcome:
- EDA ensured that report logic is data-driven, validated, and aligned with business interpretation.

## 📈 Reports Built
- After completing EDA, two business-ready reports were created using SQL views.
